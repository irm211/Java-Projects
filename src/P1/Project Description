The "Registration Management System" application is a back-end tool developed to manage participant lists for a variety of events. It facilitates the addition, verification, updating, and removal of participants from both registration and waiting lists, while also managing notifications and availability of spots automatically. Users interact with the application via a command-line interface, which offers a comprehensive set of commands for the efficient administration of registrations and participant information.
